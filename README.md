# Autonomous Driving

This repo contains model trained on the *cityscape* dataset for autonomous driving via machine learning in **Real-Time**.
For now I'm only uploading visual results complete model and evaluation metrics coming soon!

## Visual Results

The image below is a grid visualization of network's output in **real time**. The grid are in following order as shown in tabel.
To keep the video size small I only show 12 most important channels (seperatrly in grid) out of 20 channels of cityscape dataset.

original video:   final 30/20 channel output 
building: car: fence: person
pole: road: sidewalk: sky
traffic light: traffic sign: vegetation: wall
