# Autonomous Driving

This repo contains model trained on the *cityscape* dataset for autonomous driving via machine learning in **Real-Time**.
For now I'm only uploading visual results complete model and evaluation metrics coming soon!

## Visual Results

The image below is a grid visualization of network's output in **real time**. The grid are in following order as shown in tabel.
To keep the video size small I only show 12 most important channels (seperatrly in grid) out of 20 channels of cityscape dataset.

**Grid Format**
| original video| -| All Channel<br>Output|-|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|-----:|
| building     | car | fence | person|
| pole      | road     |   sidewal | sky|
| traffic light | traffic sign      |    vegetation | wall|
